This project is part of a coding assignment given by **Bitcot Technologies**.  
It is a simple React-based Contact Manager application that allows users to view, add, edit, delete, and search contacts.  
The data is initially fetched from a JSON file hosted online and displayed in a clean UI.  
Additional features include modal popups for adding/editing contacts and viewing details.  
The project demonstrates skills in React hooks, component-based architecture, and state management.
